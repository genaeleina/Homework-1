# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project:
    This project analyzes data from Kickstarters ran by Laura

### Purpose
    Use the kickstarter data to easily compare projects.

## Analysis and Challenges
   - Laura has worked on a wide vaiety kickstarters, some still on going. These projects have been all over the world. Most of the kickstarters have been for theater projects, with two thirds being sucessful and 24 still live. Music, technology and film were also very popular. Out of theater projects plays have been the most common and have been successful a little more than two thirds of the time. Almost a third of kickstarters, more in come catagories fail. Percentage funded is challenging as so many projects are less than one percent funded. This makes it difficult to do much with the data

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  
   - Use the year and dates that projects were created to make a pivot table and graph showing what months are most sucessful for launching theater projects. This allows you to tell at a glance what months have the most projects started and how many are sucessful compared to how many fail.
   
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

   -Create a chart grouping the goal amounts to show how many in each goal range were successful, cancled or failed. Using this data show the percentage of successful, cancled or failed projects. This allows you to quickly tell what percentage of successful kickstarters there are for each price range. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

    -Most difficulties were small, spelling is very important for courtifs functions. The process for filling out the table for Outcomes Based on Goals was a bit slow and repetative. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    May is the most sucessful month to start a kickstarter for a theater project, followed closely by June. October and December see a high number of failing kickstarters relitive to the number of sucessful ones. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    Projects with lower goals had a higher success rate and a smaller fail rate. There were also more projects that had lower goals, increasing their chances of success. The highest number of prjects being in the 1000 to 4999 range and the highest percentage of successful projects being in the less than 1000 range. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    This dataset doesn't make it easy to tell what country is most sucessful. Currency is also not always consistant which would change the implications for some of the goals, especially in times right now where there are drastic changes in the world currency values relative to each other. The Euro was much stronger than the US dollar until recently. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    Comparison by country and successful catagory would be a useful chart. Ideally you would want to focus on what kind of catagory is most successful in each country. Country to sucessful projects would also be useful. If one country had a high percentage of failed projects across the board that should be investigated to see what can be changed to make it more effective.
